# Customized SLDS Example

This is a simple example of how to include SLDS through npm, in order to override
design tokens and compile SLDS from the source Sass files.

This example uses Parcel as a lightweight package manager / bundler.

The example HTML is in `index.html`, and the Sass setup where you override the
design tokens and include the SLDS Source Sass for compilation exists in
`my-slds.scss`.
